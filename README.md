# Evolution-of-Dispersal
A collaboration with Chris Caudill and Jo Ash

We are building an allele-based model of the evolution of homing/straying in spatially-structured population.
Question: How does spatial heterogeneity of habitat affect the evolution of homing/straying? 
Model: Created from the descriptions given in 
  Holt, R.D., R. Gomulkiewicz, and M. Barfield.  2002.  The phenomenology of niche evolution via quantiative traits in a 'black-hole' sink.  Proceedings of the  Royal Society B 270: 215-224.
